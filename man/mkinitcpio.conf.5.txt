==================

Name
----
mktheinit.conf - mktheinit configuration file

Synopsis
--------
/etc/mktheinit.conf

Description
-----------
mktheinit will attempt to read from a config file each time it is invoked,
`/etc/mktheinit.conf' by default. This file defines several variables which
describe the contents of the image to be generated.

Variables
---------
*MODULES*::

	Defines an array of additional modules which should be added to the image.
	Dependencies (including other modules and necessary firmware), will also be
	added to the image. At runtime, the modules in this array which were
	successfully added to the image will be explicitly loaded.

*FILES*::

	Defines an array of additional files which should be added to the image.
	Files are added as is, and parent directories will be added if needed. Files
	specified in this variable will override previously added files of the same
	path.

*BINARIES*::

	Defines an array of additional binaries which should be added to the
	image. These are assumed to be dynamic ELF binaries, and necessary shared
	library dependencies will automatically be added. However, it is not
	considered an error to specify a non-ELF binary in this variable. Parent
	directories will be added if needed. Files specified in this variable will
	override previously added files of the same path.

*HOOKS*::

	Defines an array of hooks which will be run during the build process.
	Order is important, as it defines the order in which hooks will be run
	during bootup. Use mktheinit's '-L' flag to list all available hooks,
	and the '-H' flag to display the help text for a specific hook.

*COMPRESSION*::

	Defines a program to filter the generated image through. The kernel
	understands the compression formats yielded by the *zstd*, *gzip*, *bzip2*,
	*lz4*, *lzop*, *lzma*, and *xz* compressors. If unspecified, this setting
	defaults to *zstd* compression. In order to create an uncompressed image,
	define this variable as *cat*.
+
It's not hard to realize that a filter such as a *tac* or *rev* will cause
*mktheinit* to report success but generate a useless image. Similarly, using a
compression program not listed above may generate an equally useless image,
despite being "valid".

*COMPRESSION_OPTIONS*::

	Defines an array of additional options to be passed to the compression
	program. This option is generally not used. It can be potentially dangerous
	and may cause invalid images to be generated without any sign of an error.

*DECOMPRESS_MODULES*::

	Switch (yes/no) to decide wether kernel modules should be compressed or
	uncompressed during initramfs creation. Enabled by default for faster bootup
	and smaller initramfs size. Disable it to reduce RAM usage in early userspace.
